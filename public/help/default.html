<strong>Welcome to VirtualSensors!</strong>
<p><i>Our goal is to enable devopers to rapidly prototype IoT applications</i></p>
<p>
  This application in built upon IBM's Internet of Things Foundation. All virtual device data can be read from any platform that can subscribe to MQTT messages including Python, NodeJS and Node-RED.
</p>
<strong>Tutorial</strong>
<p>
  Once you are signed in, all of your virtual devices will show up as cards on this page. Each card has a couple of different componets. At the very top is the name of the device type. This type defines the format of the generated device.

       style="border:1px solid black"
       width=200px 
       height=200px />
</center>
The next line is the unique device name, then a link to get the IBM Foundation quickstart ID. The last line shows some data that the device is generating.
